<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project aims to bring together Brainhack and Open Science terms together into one, unified glossary to help newcomers quickly integrate into the community. In this project, we would like to take the glossary a step further by translating it into as many different languages as possible. This helps to remove language barriers and create an inclusive resource for all members.

**Data to use:**
The [glossary](http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/glossary_en.html#) itself and references listed at the bottom of the glossary and any other community developed open science glossaries to match the references.

**Link to project repository & resources:**
* [Brainhack Jupyter Book](http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/)
* [Main Repository](https://github.com/brainhackorg/brainhack_jupyter_book)
* [Translation Issues](https://github.com/brainhackorg/brainhack_jupyter_book/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3ATranslations)

**Goals for Brainhack Global 2022:**
Make the glossary complete with all necessary terms to serve the best of the community and translate it into different languages to make it more accessible to the global community.
