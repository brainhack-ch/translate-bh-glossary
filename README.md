<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project aims to bring together Brainhack and Open Science terms together into one, unified glossary to help newcomers quickly integrate into the community. In this project, we would like to take the glossary a step further by translating it into as many different languages as possible. This helps to remove language barriers and create an inclusive resource for all members.

In the project, you can either open a new issue and translate the glossary into a new language or you can work on an existing translation if not yet completed. The general flow of the project is as follows:

- [ ] Read and understood the project description and workflow for the translation work
- [ ] Complete the translation
- [ ] Proofread the translation
- [ ] Request a review of the translated glossary from **two native speakers**
- [ ] Incorporate the comments and edits from two native speakers into the translated glossary
- [ ] Merge the completed, proofread and reviewed translated glossary to the [main branch](https://github.com/brainhackorg/brainhack_jupyter_book) via [pull request (PR)](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request)


**Data to use:**
The [glossary](http://brainhack.org/brainhack_jupyter_book/glossary_en.html#) itself and references listed at the bottom of the glossary and any other community developed open science glossaries to match the references.
